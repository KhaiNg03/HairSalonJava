        <h2>Things to Read to Find the Right Hairstyle</h2>
        <p>Choosing a hairstyle isn't just about what's trendy, it's about finding a look that complements your unique face shape, personality, and lifestyle. The right hairstyle can enhance your best features and make you feel confident. Start by determining your face shape (oval, round, square, etc.) and explore which styles suit you best.

        <h2>How to Dry Hair Properly?</h2>
        <p>Drying your hair correctly is essential for keeping it healthy and shiny. Many people make the mistake of rubbing their hair with a towel, which can cause frizz and breakage. Instead, gently pat your hair dry or use a microfiber towel. When using a hair dryer, always apply a heat protectant to prevent damage. For a smooth finish, use a nozzle attachment and point the airflow downwards.</p>

        <h2>Daily Hair Care and Maintenance Tips</h2>
        <p>Consistent hair care is key to maintaining healthy, beautiful hair. Start with a gentle shampoo and conditioner suited to your hair type. Regular trims are essential to prevent split ends, and using nourishing oils can help keep your hair hydrated. Avoid using excessive heat and consider protective hairstyles to minimize damage. With these daily habits, your hair will stay strong and vibrant.</p>

These colors work well with various skin tones and give a fresh, modern look. If you're feeling adventurous, consider adding subtle highlights or balayage for dimension.
